# Game for "Mostra-UP 2017"

This is a very short game, created for a students fair. The main purpose of the fair is to showcase the research and learning opportunities in each faculty of the university of Porto. In the faculty of medicine, we often use statistics, probabilities and bayesian networks in research, and our purpose was to offer a taste of these tools to late teenagers, using a game.

The game was created using the [Godot engine](http://godotengine.org) (!!!which is awesome!!!) But to those interested in looking at the code, be warned: it's a mess. I don't recommend looking at it in any way. It was a journey from scratch to final in barely two weeks, with no previous knowledge of the engine. A thorough clean up is due, eventually.

Game dialogs written in [inklewriter](http://writer.inklestudios.com) (thank you to [TheHappieCat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBsuOBu-dxj5bx1KMgmar5g) for pointing me in the right direction)

Hope you like it!

N.B.: The game is in portuguese.
P.S.: The game is best played with gamepad.
